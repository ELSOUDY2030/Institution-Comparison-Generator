# Institution Comparison Generator

This repository contains a Streamlit-based web app that performs a comparative analysis of institutions across multiple countries using the power of language models from Hugging Face. Users can input the name of an institution and the app will generate a comparative analysis between the institution and its counterparts in different countries based on performance metrics, key risks, and mitigation strategies.

## Features
- Generate a comparative analysis of institutions across up to three countries.
- Use predefined or random countries for comparison.
- The analysis includes structured data points such as:
  - **Performance Metrics**: Response Time, Clearance Rate, Public Satisfaction
  - **Key Risks**: Specific to each country and institution
  - **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

## Tech Stack
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: Language models to generate the comparative analysis.
- **Hugging Face Hub**: To access and manage models.
- **BitsAndBytes**: Used for model quantization, reducing memory usage.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Institution-Comparison-Generator.git
   cd Institution-Comparison-Generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Create a virtual environment and install the required libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your Hugging Face token**
   Open `app.py` and replace the `login` function with your Hugging Face access token.
   ```python
   login("hf_your_token")
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the app**  
   The app will be running at `http://localhost:8501/` on your browser.

## Usage

- Enter the name of the institution you wish to analyze.
- Choose between using predefined countries or letting the app randomly select two countries for comparison.
- Click the "Generate Analysis" button to create the report.

## Example

1. Enter the institution name: **Police**
2. Choose countries: **Egypt, Qatar, KSA**
3. Click **Generate Analysis** to produce a comparative analysis report.
